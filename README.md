# pars3k

pars3k (parsec/parse 3000) is a library for Crystal adding support for combinator parsers.
The structure is heavily inspired by Parsec from Haskell.

## Disclaimer

This project, as of the time of writing, was made in 3 hours. It is highly experimental and lacks
good documentation, however almost any form of parser will work.
